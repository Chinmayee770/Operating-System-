# Operating System Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains various Operating System algorithms implemented in different programming languages. These algorithms are fundamental to understanding how an operating system manages processes, memory, scheduling, and file systems.

## Process Scheduling Algorithms
These algorithms determine the order in which processes execute on the CPU.
- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job Next (SJN)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**

## Memory Management Algorithms
Memory management ensures efficient allocation and deallocation of memory.
- **First Fit**
- **Best Fit**
- **Worst Fit**
- **Paging**
- **Segmentation**

## Disk Scheduling Algorithms
These algorithms optimize the order of disk I/O requests.
- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**
- **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**
- **C-SCAN**
- **LOOK**
- **C-LOOK**

## Deadlock Handling Algorithms
Deadlock occurs when processes wait for resources in a circular chain.
- **Deadlock Prevention**
- **Deadlock Avoidance (Banker's Algorithm)**
- **Deadlock Detection and Recovery**

## Synchronization Algorithms
Synchronization prevents race conditions and ensures correct execution of concurrent processes.
- **Semaphore Implementation**
- **Mutex Locks**
- **Producer-Consumer Problem**
- **Readers-Writers Problem**
- **Dining Philosophers Problem**
